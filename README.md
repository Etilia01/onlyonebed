# onlyonebed
A visual novel about fanfic tropes taken literally!

I made this for the hackclub event storyboard (https://storyboard.hackclub.com/) in 18 hours (!), writing and art included. Coding was around 5 and a half hours. The theme for this month was "cliches with a twist", so this is just that!

I made this in renpy, so technically you could just throw the code into your renpy projects folder to build the game for your OS, but its easier to just check out the itch page here: https://etilia.itch.io/only-one-bed



It was really fun making this, but also (kinda) stressful because the art took soooo much longer than expected.
